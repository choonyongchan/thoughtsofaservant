Some of my best coding sessions happen outside the house — in a corner booth with a flat white and just enough background murmur to keep me focused. Here are the cafés I keep coming back to.

## What Makes a Great Deep-Work Café?

Not every café is built for productivity. My checklist:

1. **Reliable Wi-Fi** — Non-negotiable.
2. **Power outlets** — Bonus points if they're near the window seats.
3. **Noise level** — A gentle hum, not a concert.
4. **Coffee quality** — Life's too short for bad espresso.
5. **Stay-friendly** — No side-eye after the first hour.

## My Current Favourites

### ☕ The Grind Collective

A minimalist space with long wooden tables, fast Wi-Fi, and an excellent pour-over menu. The baristas know their single-origin beans, and the playlist leans lo-fi hip-hop — which is basically the official soundtrack of focused work.

**Best for:** Long afternoon sessions.

### ☕ Bloom & Brew

Tucked away in a quiet side street, this one surprises you with its airy interior and natural light. They have a "quiet zone" in the back — no phone calls, no group meetings. Just laptops and lattes.

**Best for:** Reading papers and writing.

### ☕ Byte Café

Yes, the name is on-the-nose, but the space delivers: standing desks, USB charging ports at every table, and a loyalty card that actually pays off. Their matcha latte is dangerously good.

**Best for:** Weekend hackathons.

## A Few Tips

- **Go early.** The best seats are taken by 10 AM.
- **Bring headphones.** Even quiet cafés have their moments.
- **Buy something every couple of hours.** It's only fair — and the pastries are usually worth it.
