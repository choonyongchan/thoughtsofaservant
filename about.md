Hey there! I'm **Harry** — a computing enthusiast documenting my journey through toy projects and everyday observations.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Projects** — Hands-on experiments in Statistics, Computer Security, Computer Science, and AI. Each post walks through a small project, the reasoning behind it, and what I learned.
- **Life Snippets** — Café recommendations, thoughts on tech policy, and reflections on the intersection of technology and daily life.

## Why "Thoughts of a Servant"?

Every insight starts with a question, and every project is an act of service — to curiosity, to the craft, and to the community. This blog is my space to share that journey — the technical experiments, the everyday observations, and the lessons learned along the way.

## Get in Touch

I'm always happy to chat about projects, collaborate on ideas, or hear café recommendations.
